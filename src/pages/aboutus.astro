        <h2>SUSTAINABILITY</h2>
        <p>
          Karrusel is committed to becoming more sustainable. In order to save
          resources and reduce waste we use left over materials and timber for
          stage designs and installations. We will re-use production and print
          materials when possible year after year. Beverages are served in
          reusable or sustainable materials. Straws are not being used.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How you can help:</strong> Take a bike or public transport to the
          festival. Don’t bring confetti or glitter to the festival. There will be
          free tap water stations during the festival. Please bring an empty cup
          or bottle and drink nice free tap water.

      <h2>FESTIVAL EXPERIENCE</h2>
      <p>
        Karrusel believes in the right to a harassment-free festival experience.
        We believe in the right of everyone to express themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Karrusel welcomes everybody – all with their different orientations,
        experiences, histories and backgrounds. Karrusel only exists if everyone
        takes care of each other, respects their own and others boundaries,
        embraces diversity and acts as a part of the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you feel unsafe, please reach out to our awareness team. They will be
        wearing a pink vests and walk around the site and be at their base. Ask
        any festival staff and they will guide you to the them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take responsibility for your own actions. Respect your own and others
        boundaries. Speak up rather than look the other way
